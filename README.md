End result is very slicer dependant.
Recommended material is PLA+ (Esun is great, but also Ender, Sunlu, Overture, etc), it also works with other materials and I try to anticipate for that as best as I can but the air gaps and dimensional constraints are made for PLA.

Bed size required : 200 x 200 x 220 high (mm)
(some models might need more)

First you'll have to create the 4 printing profiles, open your favorite 0.20mm-height profile that you know works fine on your printer :

- Set infill = 0%, walls = 1, top layers = 3, bottom layers = 3
- Save as profile A
- Set walls = 2, top layers = 4, bottom layers = 4
- Save as profile B
- Set walls = 3, top layers = 5, bottom layers = 5
- Save as profile C
- Re-open profile B, set infill = 100%
- Save as profile D

- Parts are in 3MF format, not centered on the printing plate, there's a folder in the package showing the correct orientation.
- By default printing with NO supports, NO infill (excepted the D profile, 100% infill). Then see the modifier column in the speadsheets.
- Wings on all the planes are perfectly symetrical left-right, so slice the left part, then use the mirror tool and slice again, there's no need to load the 3MF file for the other side.

It's important to print at the highest possible temperature to get a good fusion, as sample with Esun PLA+ I set 235Â°C

The files and models are free of charge, just if you can share photos and videos of your projects that'd be great 

Tracks really well, and can be printed very light with PLA-LW, is the simplest and the most modular, thus making it the obvious recommendation for a beginner.

# Assembling :

You will need :
- 6 or 8mm carbon tubes, exact lengths are listed in the spreadsheet for each plane
- Some M3 screws and nuts
- Few grams of TPU needed for the flexible ailerons hinges.
- Servo linkages are recommended with a ball joint, the rods are not always pulling perpendicular to the control surface.
- CA glue, with or without activator, works very well on PLA.
- Servo wells are made for Emax MD08/09 servos, standard micro size
- On all the flying wing types, ailerons needs a small amount of reflex up, 2mm at the trailing edge.
